    <h1>Elden Ring</h1>
    <p><h2>What is it?</h2>
        Elden Ring takes place in the realm of the Lands Between, 
        sometime after the destruction of the titular Elden Ring and the scattering of its shards, 
        the Great Runes. Once graced by the Ring and the Erdtree which symbolizes its presence,
        the realm is now ruled over by the demigod offspring of Queen Marika the Eternal,
        each possessing a shard of the Ring that corrupts and taints them with power. 
        As a Tarnished—exiles from the Lands Between who lost the Ring's grace—summoned back after the Shattering, 
        players must traverse the realm to ultimately find all the Great Runes, restore the Elden Ring, and become the Elden Lord.</p>

    <p><h2>How is the gameplay?</h2>
        Elden Ring is an action role-playing game played in a third-person perspective and features elements similar to
        those found in its predecessors, the Souls series as well as Bloodborne and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, 
        with gameplay focusing on combat and exploration. Director Hidetaka Miyazaki explained that players start with a linear opening but will eventually 
        progress to freely explore the Lands Between, including its six main areas, as well as castles, fortresses, and catacombs scattered throughout the vast open-world map.
        These main areas are interconnected through a central hub that players can access later in the game's progression.
